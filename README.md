## 🧠 AI Modules

NebulaWatch is built on a multi-layered AI system designed to track, analyze, and predict blockchain behavior in real time. Below are the core detection and prediction modules that power the system.

### 🔮 1. FutureSight — Market Growth Prediction  
**Language:** Python

```python
def future_sight(market_change, previous_price, total_volume):
    prediction_factor = market_change * previous_price
    prediction_score = prediction_factor / total_volume

    if prediction_score > 0.5:
        return "Alert: Strong Market Growth Predicted"
    return "Market Growth Unlikely"
```
#### Connects temporal sequence analysis with pricing momentum to forecast potential upward trends.

### 🧠 2. MarketForecast — Volatility Detection

```javascript
function marketForecast(marketData) {
  const priceChange = marketData.currentPrice - marketData.previousPrice;
  const volatilityImpact = priceChange / marketData.previousPrice;

  if (Math.abs(volatilityImpact) > 0.1) {
    return 'Alert: Market Trend Shift Detected';
  } else {
    return 'Market Stable';
  }
}
```
#### Identifies volatility shifts in real time and feeds signals into Nebula’s broader forecasting system.

### 🪐 3. NebulaScope — Insight Extraction Module

```python
def nebula_scope(volume_change, total_volume, current_price, previous_price):
    liquidity_score = volume_change / total_volume
    trend_factor = (current_price - previous_price) / previous_price
    insight_score = liquidity_score * trend_factor

    if insight_score > 0.25:
        return "Alert: Market Insight Indicates Risk"
    return "Market Insight Clear"
```
#### Combines liquidity fluctuations with price movement to detect deep market anomalies and whale behavior.

### 🌀 4. DataShift — Structural Market Change Tracker

```javascript
function dataShift(marketData) {
  const shiftMagnitude = Math.abs(marketData.currentPrice - marketData.previousPrice);
  const marketShiftRatio = shiftMagnitude / marketData.previousPrice;

  if (marketShiftRatio > 0.2) {
    return 'Alert: Significant Market Data Shift Detected';
  } else {
    return 'Market Data Normal';
  }
}
```
#### Filters surface-level noise from real structural market changes, acting as Nebula’s first alert system.

### 🔍 Deep AI Architecture
### Where raw data becomes foresight

#### Nebula is more than a Chrome extension — it’s a layered neural system composed of modular AI "sensors" working together in real time.

### 🧠 Detection Layer — Pattern & Volatility Triggers
- DataShift acts as a tripwire for price and liquidity anomalies
- TrendMap quantifies trend shifts with volatility interaction metrics
- Together, they detect early warning signals before deeper modules activate

### 🔮 Interpretation Layer — Predictive Sequence Modeling
- FutureSight and MarketForecast leverage LSTM-like modeling
- They analyze real-time and historical data to map likely future movements
- This layer forms the forecasting timeline of Nebula’s AI

### 🔭 Insight Layer — Deep Correlation & Risk Scoring
- NebulaScope correlates liquidity behavior with price direction
- Used to detect whale activity, hidden manipulation, and coordinated pumps
- Results feed into risk scoring overlays and planned heatmaps

### 🧬 AI Feedback Loops & Adaptive Learning
- All modules produce output and send feedback into the system
- Confirmed predictions retrain the AI weekly for higher accuracy
- Nebula evolves continuously with changing market behavior
